I've been neglecting my personal site for too long. Today I'm starting fresh.

The old site sat there, gathering dust, while I was busy building products and writing code. That's the irony of being a developer — the cobbler's children have no shoes. You spend all day building things for other people and your own corner of the internet looks abandoned.

## Why Jekyll

I considered a dozen options. A Rails app (obviously), a fancy JavaScript framework, a headless CMS with a static frontend. But the obvious answer kept staring at me: Jekyll.

It's Ruby-based, which means I'm already comfortable with it. It's hosted free on GitHub Pages. Posts are just Markdown files in a folder. There's no database, no deployment pipeline, no server to maintain. I write a file, push it to Git, and it's live.

For a personal site where the primary goal is writing and showcasing work, this is exactly the right amount of tool.

## What's Coming

I plan to write about what I'm building, what I'm learning, and what I think about the Rails ecosystem in 2026. Expect posts about ViewComponents, Hotwire patterns, product development as a solo builder, and the occasional opinion about where web development is heading.

If any of that interests you, stick around. I'll try to make it worth your time.
