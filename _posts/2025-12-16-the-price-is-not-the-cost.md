A year ago, I fought with AI over an OK-ish commit message.
Now I run agent swarms.

That escalated quickly.

Every week in 2025, experts said "AI is improving, get ready." They undersold it. We're not improving, we're in free-fall acceleration. The kind where you check your phone for an hour and three new capabilities dropped while you weren't looking. 

Mid December 2025, I coordinate agents with specialized skills. They have objectives. They complete tasks. They work while I think about what's next.

Who predicted solo developers or creators could do this in early 2025? Nobody. Not even the people building the tools. They all say, "we don't know how AI works!" Which is both terrifying and hilarious.

And, the trade-off? Time. Learn one thing Monday, it's ancient history by Friday. It's like TikTok scrolling, except the algorithm is super-intelligence and nobody programmed a pause button. The Genie is out.

The train isn't just moving, it's breaking the speed limit. You're either on it or watching from the platform. (Spoiler, the platform sells tickets to nowhere land.)

But here's the beautiful part, that same insane speed means you can build things this year (2 weeks left!) that were science fiction or a dream early this year. You can help more people. Create more value. Ship products faster. Leave something behind.

Because if time flies, and AI flies faster, then builders who can keep up will build useful things -not slop- that seemed impossible.

So… what are you building while the train is moving?
