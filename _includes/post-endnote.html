  <p>I'm Ahmed Nadar, a Rails developer in Toronto. I've been building web applications for over 15 years. I created RapidRails UI because Rails developers deserve native frontend components that work the way Rails works, without reaching for React or external JavaScript libraries.</p>
  <p>If your app has forms, tables, or workflows that feel harder than they should, I'd like to help.</p>
