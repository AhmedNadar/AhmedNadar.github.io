description: "Software developer and product builder in Toronto. I build production apps with Ruby on Rails."
---

I'm Ahmed, a software developer and product builder based in Toronto. For the last ten years I have been doing the same thing: figuring out what people actually need and turning that into working software. That part has not changed. What changed is how fast I can do it.

## How I Work

It starts with the problem. I ask questions and keep asking until I understand not just what someone wants built but why they need it. Following by designing the flow, thinking through the architecture, and building it in Rails tools like RapidRails UI components, StimulusJS and Hotwire.

I use AI agents throughout the build phase. Tools like Claude Code help me write, test, and iterate faster than I could alone. The thinking and product decisions are mine. The implementation moves at a speed that used to require a whole team.

Every product on this page was built this way. From first conversation to live users.

## What I'm Building

**[FixOurHood](https://fixourhood.ca)** is a civic issue reporting tool for Toronto neighborhoods. Any resident can report any issue in 10 seconds. I talked to residents, understood what was frustrating about reporting local issues, designed the flow, and built the whole thing with Rails and AI agents. It is live and serving real users.

**[RapidRails](https://rapidrails.cc)** is a production ready UI component library for Rails. Every component I kept rebuilding across client projects, packaged into one library. No React, no complex JS build tools. Components that work inside Rails natively and easily with AI agents as they understand the components structure and how they work better than plain html and css.

**[ShipIt.day](https://shipit.day)** is an accountability tool for builders. Connect your GitHub, track your progress publicly, and stay honest about what you are actually shipping. Share notes with your team, keep yourself accountable, and get feedback on your work. ~80% AI-assisted.

## What I Believe

Writing code is not the hard part anymore. Understanding the problem is. Knowing what to build, for whom, and why. That has always been the real skill in software and it is the only one that matters more now, not less.

One developer who understands the problem deeply and uses the right tools can build what used to take a team. I have been doing that for ten years. The tools got better. The work stayed the same.
