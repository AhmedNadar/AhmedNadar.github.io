description: "Rails developer building products and shipping code from Toronto."
---

I'm Ahmed, a Ruby on Rails developer based in Toronto. I build products, write code, and occasionally write about both.

## What I Do

I specialize in Rails development with a focus on frontend architecture — ViewComponents, Stimulus, Hotwire, and Tailwind. I've spent years refining how Rails applications handle their UI layer, and I think the ecosystem has never been better for solo developers building real products.

## What I'm Building

**RapidRails** is a production-ready UI component library for Rails. It gives developers the building blocks they need without leaving the Rails ecosystem. No React, no complex JavaScript build tools — just components that work.

**ShipIt.day** is an accountability tool for builders. Connect your GitHub, track your progress publicly, and stay honest about what you're actually shipping.

**RailsExpert** connects Rails developers with clients who value their expertise.

## What I Believe

Simple solutions beat clever ones. The best tools feel obvious once you use them. Rails is the most productive framework for solo developers, and 2025 is the best time ever to build with it.
