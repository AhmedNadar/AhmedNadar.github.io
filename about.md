description: "Rails developer who pairs deep product thinking with AI tools to ship fast. Based in Toronto."
---

I'm Ahmed, a software developer and product builder based in Toronto. I pair Ruby on Rails with AI agents like Claude Code to ship production software at a pace that used to require entire teams.

## How I Work

I specialize in Rails, RapidRails UI components which are built with ViewComponents, Stimulus, Hotwire, Tailwind. I've spent years refining how Rails apps handle their UI layer. But the real shift in my workflow came when I started building with AI.

I use Claude Code, agentic workflows, and AI-assisted development daily. Not as a crutch — as a multiplier. I still make every architectural decision, review every line, and own every product. AI handles the throughput. I handle the thinking.

**FixOurHood** was built 90% with this workflow and is live in production, serving real users in Toronto. That wasn't a shortcut — it was a faster path to the same quality bar.

## What I'm Building

**[RapidRails](https://rapidrails.cc)** — A production-ready UI component library for Rails. No React, no complex JS build tools. Just components that work inside Rails.

**[FixOurHood](https://fixourhood.ca)** — Civic issue reporting for Toronto neighborhoods. Built almost entirely with AI-assisted development using Claude Code.

**[ShipIt.day](https://shipit.day)** — Accountability tool for builders. Connect your GitHub, track progress publicly, and stay honest about what you're actually shipping. ~80% AI-assisted.

## What I Believe

One developer with Rails and AI can build what used to take a team. Simple solutions beat clever ones. The best tools feel obvious once you use them.

The developers who learn to work *with* AI — not just use it as autocomplete — will define the next decade of software.
