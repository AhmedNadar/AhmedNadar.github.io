ShipIt.day is an accountability tool for builders. Connect your GitHub, track your progress publicly, and stay honest about what you are actually shipping. Share notes with your team, keep yourself accountable, and get feedback on your work.

## How It Works

Connect your GitHub account and ShipIt.day tracks your commit activity. It visualizes your building streaks, highlights your most productive patterns, and holds you publicly accountable to your goals.

## Why Public Accountability

Private todo lists are where ambition goes to die. When other builders can see your progress, you show up differently. Not because of external pressure, but because visibility creates clarity about what actually matters.

## Built For Builders

If you ship software, create content, or build products and you want an honest mirror for your work habits, ShipIt.day is for you.
