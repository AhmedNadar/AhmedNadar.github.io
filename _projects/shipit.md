ShipIt.day started as a tool I built for myself. I wanted a simple way to track what I was actually shipping — not what I planned to ship, not what I hoped to ship, but what I committed to Git.

## How It Works

Connect your GitHub account and ShipIt.day tracks your commit activity. It visualizes your building streaks, highlights your most productive patterns, and holds you publicly accountable to your goals.

## Why Public Accountability

Private todo lists are where ambition goes to die. When other builders can see your progress, you show up differently. Not because of external pressure, but because visibility creates clarity about what actually matters.

## Built For Builders

If you ship software, create content, or build products — and you want an honest mirror for your work habits — ShipIt.day is for you.
