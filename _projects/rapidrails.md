RapidRails is a production ready UI component library for Rails. Every component I kept rebuilding across client projects, packaged into one library. No React, no complex JS build tools. Components that work inside Rails natively and easily with AI agents as they understand the components structure and how they work better than plain HTML and CSS.

## The Problem

Rails developers have always been second class citizens in the frontend world. React, Vue, and Angular get beautiful component libraries. Rails gets Bootstrap slapped on top of ERB. The result is either ugly defaults or a complete departure from Rails conventions to adopt a JavaScript framework.

## The Approach

RapidRails gives you ViewComponents, Stimulus controllers, and Tailwind powered styling that feel native to Rails. No build step complexity. No JavaScript framework overhead. Just components that work the way Rails developers expect. And because each component has a clear structure, AI agents can use them effectively to build interfaces faster than writing raw HTML and CSS.

## Stack

ViewComponent, Stimulus, Hotwire, and Tailwind CSS. Ships as a Ruby gem. Install it, use it, ship it.
