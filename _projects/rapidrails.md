RapidRails is a UI component library built for Rails developers who want polished, production-ready frontend components without leaving the Rails ecosystem.

## The Problem

Rails developers have always been second-class citizens in the frontend world. React, Vue, and Angular get beautiful component libraries. Rails gets... Bootstrap slapped on top of ERB. The result is either ugly defaults or a complete departure from Rails conventions to adopt a JavaScript framework.

## The Approach

RapidRails gives you ViewComponents, Stimulus controllers, and Tailwind-powered styling that feel native to Rails. No build step complexity. No JavaScript framework overhead. Just components that work the way Rails developers expect.

## Stack

Built with ViewComponent, Stimulus, Hotwire, and Tailwind CSS. Ships as a Ruby gem. Install it, use it, ship it.
