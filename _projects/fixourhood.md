FixOurHood is a civic issue reporting tool for Toronto neighborhoods. Any resident can report any issue in 10 seconds. I talked to residents, understood what was frustrating about reporting local issues, designed the flow, and built the whole thing with Rails and AI agents. It is live and serving real users.

## The Problem

Toronto's 311 system handles 600+ service types but costs the city **$11 to $16 per phone call**, and fewer than 20% of residents use the app. The existing app assumes you already know how city departments work, which category your issue falls under, and how to write a formal complaint. Most people notice problems every day and never report them because it is too annoying.

## How It Works

The workflow is three steps. **Spot** an issue and snap a photo. **Send** it through FixOurHood where AI analyzes the image and generates a proper report. The city's **Fix** teams get notified with everything they need to act. Reports are also posted publicly on a community map so neighbors can see what is happening and verify issues.

## What Makes It Different

Community verification lets neighbors vote on reports, building trust through crowd validation. Toronto's 25 municipal wards are fully integrated. You can view issues by ward, see ward boundaries on the map, and get ward specific statistics. Every report gets detailed resolution tracking with status updates and before/after documentation.

## Stack

Ruby on Rails. AI powered photo analysis for automatic issue categorization. Interactive map with ward boundaries. Community voting and verification system. Built with AI agents using Claude Code.
