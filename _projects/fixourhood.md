FixOurHood makes it dead simple for Toronto residents to report infrastructure problems — potholes, illegal parking, broken streetlights, graffiti, abandoned vehicles — and get them in front of the right people.

## The Problem

Toronto's 311 system handles 600+ service types but costs the city $11–16 per phone call, and fewer than 20% of residents use the app. The existing app assumes you already know how city departments work, which category your issue falls under, and how to write a formal complaint. Most people notice problems every day and never report them because it's too annoying.

## How It Works

The workflow is three steps: **Spot** an issue and snap a photo, **Send** it through FixOurHood where AI analyzes the image and generates a proper report, and the city's **Fix** teams get notified with everything they need to act. Reports are also posted publicly on a community map so neighbors can see what's happening and verify issues.

## What Makes It Different

Community verification lets neighbors vote on reports, building trust through crowd validation. Toronto's 25 municipal wards are fully integrated — you can view issues by ward, see ward boundaries on the map, and get ward-specific statistics. Every report gets detailed resolution tracking with status updates and before/after documentation.
