    <div class="narrative-body reveal-child">
      <p>I started in design, moved to frontend, and landed on the thing I care about most: building products that people actually use. Not prototypes. Not demos. Real products with real customers.</p>
      <p>Everything I build runs on my own Ruby on Rails stack and I pair it with AI tools like Claude Code to ship at a pace that used to require entire teams. <strong>FixOurHood was built 90% with AI-assisted development and is live in production.</strong> That's the workflow now: deep problem domain knowledge and developer expertise paired with AI speed.</p>

    <h2 class="narrative-heading reveal-child">I write code — with AI.</h2>
    <div class="narrative-body reveal-child">
      <p>I got my start as a designer, but became obsessed with the gap between beautiful mockups and real, working software. That led to years of frontend & backend development, then UI component architecture, and now building full products from scratch.</p>
      <p>Today I work with AI as a development partner. Claude Code, cursor-based workflows, agentic tools, I use them daily to write, review, and ship code faster. <strong>Not to replace thinking, but to multiply output.</strong> The result: I ship products in weeks that used to take months.</p>
